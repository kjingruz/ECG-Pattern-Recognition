# ECG-Pattern-Recognition


Using Tensorflow and Python, I developed an ECG pattern recognition algorithm that can recognize abnorality in ECG pulse waves. Using online open database from PhysioNet and an accuracy of 97.97%, this model can be widely used to determine ECG pulse waves in wfdb format.
